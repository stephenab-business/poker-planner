# PokerPlanner
This project was created for my Introduction to Web Design and Development class and was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.12.

## Purpose
Using Angular, I created a web-application that a person could use to input what type of Poker cards they had in their hand. When all cards were inputted, it would notify the user what type of Texas Hold'em hand they had so that they could decide on their last bet.

## Database
Poker Planner utilized Firebase as its database, and could allow for the user to save their hands, update them, or delete them (CRUD).

## Results
The application was unfortunately never finished due to the class ending, thus ending my need to finish it.
